Software Dependencies:

Python: The code utilizes Python for data manipulation and analysis.
Libraries: Several libraries are required, including:
pandas for data import and manipulation
nltk for text processing techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization (word cloud, bar chart)
collections for counting word frequencies (optional)
contractions for handling contractions (optional)
emoji for handling emojis (optional)
beautifulsoup4 for removing HTML tags (optional)
Data Requirements:

CSV File: The code assumes a CSV file named "Reviews.csv" containing the review data. This file should have a column named "Review" that stores the actual text content of each review.
Data Quality: Ideally, the review data should be clean and consistent. Missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information might need to be addressed before processing.
